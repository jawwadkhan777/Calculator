# Basic Calculator in Java

This repository contains the implementation of a **Basic Calculator** in Java that performs standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project was created as part of my internship at **TechnoHacks EduTech**, where I applied the concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to build a clean, modular, and extensible calculator.

## Project Overview 📚

The calculator can handle:
- **Addition**
- **Subtraction**
- **Multiplication**
- **Division**

## Features 🛠️

- **User-friendly** console-based calculator.
- Handles standard arithmetic operations with input validation.
- Built using Java and IntelliJ IDEA for easy code structuring and readability.

## OOP Concepts Implemented 🌟

- **Class Design**: Modular structure using different classes for handling operations.
- **Error Handling**: Ensuring operations like division by zero are properly handled.

## Get Started 🚀

To get started with this project, simply clone this repository and open the desired queue implementation file in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA). No additional setup is required!
